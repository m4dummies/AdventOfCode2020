## How can you use my script? 
You just need to have python installed on your computer, if you do you can easily run my scripts. I don't think i would be using any modules but check the readme file just in case :) 
I will make sure to attach a requirements.txt there.



## Contribute!

It would be great if you guys could ping me with ways in which i could improve and make my script more efficient as I myself am a student and looking to improve. Thanks.
