#  --- Day 4: Passport Processing ---

This challenge was really fun, the first part was fairly easy. 

<b>Part 1 -</b>
I saved the given data to a text file and made python read it. I then split the whole file by empty new line. By doing this I got groups of data. 
The next step was just checking wether they fall in the give criteria and BOOM, we have the answer (for me it was `192`),

<b>Part 2 - </b>
Still working on it, will update soon :)
