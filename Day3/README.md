### --- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---

So I took a rather different approach to this problem, instead of using a coordinate system, I wrote a function to extend the map as the question mentioned: <br/> `arboreal genetics and biome stability`. 

I used the the complicated approach in the first part of it and decided to use the coordinate system to crack the second part of the question. 
So I used three files two for the first part and one for the second.
